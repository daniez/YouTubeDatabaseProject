# YouTubeDatabaseProject

This application allows a user to create a database table to save the results of the user's searches of YouTube. This LINKS table contains urls of videos found on YouTube as well as descriptions of the videos. Each user has his or her own LINKS table containing results of his or her YouTube searches. The user can save these results with a predefined or user-defined category for ease of later retrieval.

This LINKS table can then be searched by the user. Basic and advanced search functions are included. The LINKS table can also be customized. The user can delete records from LINKS table, update the category of specified records, or print records to file.

See UserManual.doc for more information.
